# How was Today
```
There was a problem which is my markdown file is pointing to a link of file that I recently commited 
    because the web name is same like 2021-03. The problem occured because I named my file like 
    2021-03-30-Mon, 2021-03-31-Tue, etc.
Therefore, I changed all file names so that I can see my TIL and Study in my blog
