# Computer Networks

## Foundation

### Application Protocol
```
URL
    Uniform Resource Locater
    통합된 리소스 위치 지시자.
    17 messages for one URL Request
        6 IP address
        3 TCP connection
        4 HTTP request and ack
        4 TCP termination

HTTP
    Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

TCP
    Transmission Control Protocol

```

### Requirements
```
Connectivity
    Scale
    Link
    Nodes
    Point to point
    Multiple Access
    Switched Network
        Circuit Switched
        Packet Switched
    Packet Message
    Store and Forward

    Cloud
    Hosts
    Switches
    internetwork
    Router/Gateway
    Host-to-host Connectivity
    Address
    Routing
    Unicast/broadcast/multicast

Cost Effective Resource Sharing
    Multiplexing
    De-multiplexing
    Synchronous Time-Division Multiplexing

    FDM

    Statistical Multiplexing
        FIFO
        Round-Robin
        Pirorities
    
    LAN
        Local Area Networks
        A network connecting a group of devices in a “local” area, usually within the same building. 
        These connections are generally powered through the use of Ethernet cables, 
            which have length limitations, as the speed of the connection will degrade beyond a certain length.

        A WLAN, or wireless LAN, is a subtype of LAN. It uses WiFi to make the LAN wireless through the use of a wireless router.
    WAN
        Wide Area Networks
        covering any distance neccessary like internet

    MAN
        metropolitan area network
        These can cover an area as large as a city, linking multiple LANs through a wired backhaul.
            Citywide Wifi network    
    SAN
        System Area Networks
        high-performance, connection-oriented network that can link a cluster of computers

### Description of Layers
```
Physical Layer
    handles the transmission of raw bits over a communication link

Data Link Layer
    collects a stream of bits called "frame"

Network Layer
    exchange "packet" btw nodes

Transport Layer
    implements a process to process channel
    exchange "message"

Session & Presentation
    provides a name space that is used to tie together 
        & format of data exchanged btw peers

Application Layer
    standardize common type of exchanges

```

### Internet Architecture
```
An hour-glass shape = 모래시계 
1. NET NET NET NET
2. IP
3. TCP & UDP
4. FTP HTTP NV TFTP
```

### API
```
Application Programming Interface
    sockets
        originally provided by Unix / C

        Interface btw an application and network
            create socket
            attach a socket to the network
            send and recv
            close socket
        
        Server
            bind 연결 설정
            listen 기다림
            accept 연결 후 수행

        Client
            connect 연결
        
```

### Performance
```
 Bandwidth
    width of the frequency band
    number of bits per sec

    1Mbps: 1 * 10^6 = 1 * 2^20 
        <--> 1 * 10^(-6) seconds to transmit each bit
                = 1 microsec wide

Latency = Propagation + transmit + queue + processing
    propagation = distance / speed of light
    Transmit = size / bandwidth

Throughput = TransferSize / Transfer Time

```

* For larget file transfer, bw is critical
* For small size messages, latency is critical


## Switching and Forwarding

### Switching
```
Circuit Switching   
    전화
    Physical layer technology

Packet Switching
    datagram: indendent, Internet
        connectionless
        mostly used on network layer
        routing table, forwarding table에 따라 길 할당 at any time

    virtual circuit switching
        connection-oriented
        VCI: Virtual Circuit Indetifier
        permanent VC: 연결로 유지
        Switched VC: 연결로 할당
        new connection --> new VCI
    VCI 예제 다시!
